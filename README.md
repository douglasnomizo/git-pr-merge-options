# Github Merge Options

The goal of this repository is to provide examples of using the 3 Github options available for merging PRs:
- Merge
- Squash and Merge
- Rebase and Merge

## Branches

All branches will be merged into master using the option defined by their names:
- merge-branch
- rebase-branch
- squash-branch


## Rebase and Merge

All commits from your branch `rebase-branch` are added to `master`
In this example we have the following commits:
- rebase: adding README.md file
- rebase: add information to README.md
- rebase: fix typo
- rebase: add rebase branch merging info
